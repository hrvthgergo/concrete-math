# Concrete Mathematics
## this is a home project and i will try to document my learning process related to the book called Concrete Mathematics by Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth (REK), Oren Patashnik.

i will learn selected topics from the book and if possible create some code related to the given topic.
all of my code are going to be written in C and/or python (depends on the time i have).
